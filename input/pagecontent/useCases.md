*The use cases page should describe the use cases that an implementation is expected to support. Simple diagrams picturing the use cases and sequence diagrams where orchestration between multiple systems is required are helpful for understanding how the implementation should be used. It should outline the kinds of actors and users expected to take part in any interactions.*
